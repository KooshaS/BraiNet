# BraiNet
In this project, a platform (BraiNet) for pervasive monitoring and processing of brain signals is developed. EEG-based applciations can utilizes BraiNet to provide pervasive services to the users. An example application (Neuro-Movie) is developed, which makes changes in a playing movie on a mobile phone based on the user's brain signals. Multiple users can connect their brains to the application to control the movie scenes by aggregating the group mental states.
